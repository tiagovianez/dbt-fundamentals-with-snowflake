# **dbt Fundamentals Course**

## **Overview**
Welcome to the **dbt Fundamentals Course**! This course is designed to provide you with the foundational knowledge and skills needed to effectively use **dbt (Data Build Tool)**. Whether you're a data analyst, engineer, or just someone curious about modern data workflows, this course equips you with hands-on experience to transform raw data into actionable insights.

By the end of the course, you'll have the confidence to:
- Build and manage dbt projects.
- Transform and model data.
- Test and document data pipelines.
- Work effectively within the modern data stack.

## **Key Topics Covered**

### 1. **Introduction to dbt**
- What is dbt and why is it essential in the modern data stack?
- The difference between ETL and ELT workflows.
- Key features of dbt: Transformations, Testing, Documentation, and Lineage.

### 2. **Getting Started with dbt**
- Setting up your dbt environment (dbt Cloud or CLI).
- Configuring your `profiles.yml` and connecting to data warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, or Redshift.

### 3. **Modeling Data with dbt**
- Writing SQL models (`.sql` files) and defining dependencies with `ref()`.
- Materializations: **view**, **table**, and **incremental**.
- Using `dbt run` to materialize models in your data warehouse.

### 4. **Testing Data**
- Applying generic tests like `unique` and `not_null`.
- Writing custom tests to validate data quality.
- Running tests with `dbt test` and interpreting results.

### 5. **Documenting and Lineage**
- Writing descriptions for models, sources, and columns in `schema.yml`.
- Visualizing data lineage with dbt's DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).
- Generating and serving documentation with `dbt docs generate` and `dbt docs serve`.

### 6. **Source Freshness**
- Defining and testing source freshness in `sources.yml`.
- Understanding how dbt ensures data reliability.

### 7. **Working with the Modern Data Stack**
- Integrating dbt with tools like Snowflake, BigQuery, Looker, and more.
- Best practices for version control with dbt projects.
- Collaborating effectively with teams in dbt Cloud.
